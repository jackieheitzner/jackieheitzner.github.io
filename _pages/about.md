I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. I am majoring in Psychology with a research-intensive specialization and Social Development Studies with a social work specialization. 

Some of my current research focuses have been in cognitive neuroscience psychology with a particular interest in human attention. Some of my recent projects have looked at attention in educational contexts. 

Outside of my academics, I spend my free time doing historical fencing through the [Society for Creative Anachronism](http://www.sca.org/) (SCA), competitive [fencing](https://www.uwaterloofencing.ca/) with the University of Waterloo's women's sabre team, and helping out with the [Psychology EDI Working Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology-equity-diversity-inclusion/) on campus.
