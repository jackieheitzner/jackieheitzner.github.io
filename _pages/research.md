My research interests in my undergraduate degree mostly fall under a cognitive neuroscience psychology perspective. At this present time, I am interested in three key questions:
 * How different components of online learning platforms such as (Microsoft Teams and Zoom) affect attention.
 * How motivation can be manipulated or boosted in online learning.
 * How clinical and cognitive psychologists define attention. More specifically, I am looking to see what similarities and differences exist between the two domains.
