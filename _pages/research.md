My research interests in my undergraduate degree mostly fall under a cognitive neuroscience psychology perspective. At this present time, I am interested in a few different areas:

      *Firstly, I am interested in how different components of online learning platforms such as (Microsoft Teams and Zoom) affect attention.

      *Secondly, I am interested in how motivation can be manipulated or boosted in online learning.
      
      *Lastly, I am interested in how clinical psychologists and cognitive psychologists define attention. More specifically I am looking to see what similarities and differences exist between the two domains.
