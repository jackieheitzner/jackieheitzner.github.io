<p>The following ten articles were selected for their diversity in their
scope of attention and applications. I have provided my review of each
of the articles below.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Research Review: Transdiagnostic neuroscience of child
and adolescent mental disorders – differentiating decision making in
attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, depression,
and anxiety</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses on attention within the scope of
decision-making. Attention is further examined in decision-making within
the scope of other disorders. These disorders include the following:
ADHD, Conduct disorder, depression and anxiety. In their traditional
model of decision-making, the authors argue that when individuals have
issues that cause dysregulation in their normal self-referential
processes, it can lead them to have disruptions in their decision-making
performance; this is because of lapses of attention. For ADHD, the
authors argue that individuals with ADHD are more prone to spontaneous
lapses in attention. <span class="citation"
data-cites="sonugabarke_annual_2016">(Sonuga‐Barke et al.,
2016)</span></p>
<p>In general, this article makes use of the concept of attention with
regard to decision-making. It focuses on the observance of lapses of
attention as a means of defining what particular facet of attention they
are interested in. This article lends itself well to those who focus on
attention from a clinical perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive characterization of adult attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder by domains: a systematic review</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses on ADHD and, in particular, focuses on the
different domains of ADHD that are experienced by adults with ADHD. Due
to the nature of this article being a systematic review, it can give us
an overview of how different articles focus on other domains. In the
article, the authors define the cognitive domains as “(1) attention, (2)
executive functions (including working memory or similar theoretical
constructs), (3) learning and memory, (4) Language, (5) social
cognition, and (6) arithmetic.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="onandia-hinchado_cognitive_2021">(Onandia-Hinchado et al.,
2021, p. 897)</span> This article gives a broad overview with regard to
attention, with them saying that most ADHD studies find a worse
attentional performance for those with ADHD than those without. Later in
the article, they give more specificity to what specific attentional
performance could look like. Some of these definitions of attention
include attention as attentional modalities (alertness, selective and
sustained attention), or as inattention with there being an absence of
attention, as well as in terms of divided attention.</p>
<p>This article, in general, does a good job of looking at a more
precise idea of what attention is when it comes to those with ADHD. The
article also covers different ways of measuring attention, including
self-reports, test performance and experimental measures on tasks. This
article would be most interesting to those who would like to look at
attention through a clinical lens.</p>
<p><strong>A comprehensive review of attention tests: can we assess what
we exactly do not understand?</strong></p>
<p>This article places more emphasis on the tests that researchers can
use to measure attention rather than what specifically they see
attention as. Still, in general, the authors have provided a suitable
definition of attention as (see page 2) “a cognitive process matching
data from the environment to the needs of the organism.” And “being able
to focus on one thing and ignore other stimuli.” This article does a
good job of offering explanations of the different aspects of attention,
such as tonic alertness, phasic alertness, selective attention and
sustained attention. The authors also explain attention based on how it
functions, such as bottom-up processing versus top-down processing. The
article goes on to summarize 20 different attention tests, going into
detail on the assessed attention domain, the type of assessment, the age
range of the test and the estimated completion time. <span
class="citation" data-cites="nasiri_comprehensive_2023">(Nasiri et al.,
2023)</span></p>
<p>In general, this article does a good job addressing the idea of
attention as not being constrained to one specific definition but goes
on to list the different aspects of attention as well as the different
tests that currently exist to measure attention. This article provides a
good overview of attention in a general domain. This article would be of
interest to those who would like to look at ways to measure attention in
experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine
Learning</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses on two key ideas. The first of which is to let
researchers who study machine learning to understand how attention is
understood and studied in psychology and neuroscience, and the second
idea is to inform those who focus on biological attention on how
attention is defined in artificial systems. In the section that focuses
on attention in neuroscience and psychology, attention is broken up into
eight different subgroupings. The groupings are as follows: Attention as
Arousal, Alertness or vigilance, Sensory attention, visual-spatial
attention, visual feature attention, computational models of visual
attention, attention in other sensory modalities, attention and
executive control and attention and memory. This article also goes into
good detail about how attention can be and is incorporated into computer
science. <span class="citation"
data-cites="lindsay_attention_2020">(Lindsay, 2020)</span></p>
<p>In general, this article provides a good summary of the current
theories and definitions of what attention is in psychology as well as
machine learning. This article would be useful for those who would like
to look at a broader scope of what attention can look like in other
settings, such as neuroscience and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>A comparative review of the psychophysiology of attention in
children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder</strong></p>
<p>In this article, there is a particular focus of attention with regard
to the filter paradigm of attention. Further, the article looks at what
differences exist in the psychophysiology of attention for those who
have ADHD and those who do not. The article gives a good summary via a
table on page 44 on the current framework of paradigms of attention in
ADHD. <span class="citation"
data-cites="karakas_comparative_2022">(Karakaş, 2022)</span></p>
<p>In general, this article focuses more on a clinical psychology view
of attention with a specific emphasis on ADHD. I would recommend this
article to those interested in a clinical psychology perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Attention: a descriptive taxonomy</strong></p>
<p>This article uses approaches from biology that look to define
attention in the scope of a taxonomy, similar to what you might see when
classifying animals or plants. This article is comprehensive in the way
that it breaks down the various areas of attention and applications of
attention. <span class="citation"
data-cites="kaldas_attention_2022">(Kaldas, 2022)</span></p>
<p>In general, I would recommend this article to those coming from a
biology background or to those who would like to look at a very detailed
and comprehensive way of structuring what we think is attention. This
article also provides an atypical approach to classifying attention,
which might be of interest to readers.</p>
<p><strong>No one knows what attention is</strong></p>
<p>This article points out the flaws in how attention is used in
research as an overarching umbrella term. The authors of this article
point out that the broadness of this umbrella approach has caused gaps
in what we understand attention to be. The authors instead propose that
using an approach that focuses on the processes and mechanisms of
attention would better serve research in cognitive psychology. <span
class="citation" data-cites="hommel_no_2019">(Hommel et al.,
2019)</span></p>
<p>I would recommend this article to those who would like to focus on
attention as more of a bottom-up definitional process in which the
definition is derived from what it is describing rather than a top-down
focus in which the focus of the definition would start with the
broadness of “attention” and move more specific from there.</p>
<p><strong>Current Issues in the Diagnosis of Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct
Disorder.</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses mostly on how the three disorders (ADHD,
Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct disorder) have been
diagnosed. Of interest is the section on the historical view of how
attention was considered in the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. <span
class="citation" data-cites="frick_current_2012">(Frick &amp; Nigg,
2012)</span></p>
<p>While this article may not be the most relevant for those who are
keenly interested in attention more broadly, I did include this article
because it does provide an interesting perspective that is most relevant
for clinical psychologists since it looks at the DSM and the diagnosis
of these disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Data‑driven profiles of attention‑deficit/hyperactivity
disorder using objective and ecological measures of attention,
distractibility, and hyperactivity.</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses on a study in which the authors applied
ecological and performance-based measures to assess ADHD. They measured
inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. This study was conducted to
add more validity to research on ADHD. <span class="citation"
data-cites="fernandez-martin_data-driven_2023">(Fernández-Martín et al.,
2023)</span></p>
<p>This study is an interesting case that highlights how more typical
cognitive psychology approaches to measuring attention can be applied to
clinical scenarios in which more of the work has been focused on
observations and self-reports.</p>
<p><strong>Attention as a patchwork concept</strong></p>
<p>This article focuses on attention in a conceptual way rather than an
application-based context. It makes use of the broad attentional
definitions that exist over domains and proposes a way to categorize
them in such a way that benefits researchers who use attention in their
work. The article proposes attention as a way to guide thinking about
concepts in psychology. <span class="citation"
data-cites="taylor_attention_2023">(Taylor, 2023)</span></p>
<p>I think this article does a good job of critiquing attention for how
broad it can be and how attention does not always line up in terms of
how definitions look across domains. This article provides a positive
spin on these issues and how it can still be a useful way for
researchers to think about how concepts can be applied in more specific
contexts within different domains.</p>
